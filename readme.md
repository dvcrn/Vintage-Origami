Vintage Origami
===============

Origami is an awesome Sublime Text plugin that lets you conveniently configure your panel layout using shortcut keys.

Vintage Origami is just a bunch of additional shortcut keys for Vintage users so that the use of arrow keys can be avoided and `j`,`k`,`h`,`l` can be used instead.
